In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with regards to object ownership and the `retain`/`release` cycle (or its counterpart, Automatic Reference Counting â€“ ARC).  Consider a scenario where you create an object and pass it to a method, but forget to handle its ownership appropriately within that method. This could lead to a memory leak (if the object is not released) or a crash (if the object is released prematurely or double released). 

For example:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod:(NSString *)aString {
    self.myString = aString; // This retains aString
}
@end

// ... in another method ...
MyClass *obj = [[MyClass alloc] init];
NSString *str = [NSString stringWithString:@
